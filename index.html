        <b>It’s in the Beans!</b>
        
        <p>A good cup of coffee must begin with the very best beans. We purchase fairly traded beans, organic beans and single origin natural beans. Many of which, come from farmers who would otherwise have a hard time getting their high-quality beans to market.</p>

    <h3>  
        <b>The Espresso Royale Story</b>
        
        <p>Espresso Royale has always been known for its friendly staff, unmatched drink quality, and a service style that is casual and welcoming. “We don’t tell people what they will like, we listen to them,” says the company’s founder. “Each Espresso Royale Café, as well as the drinks we serve, are a reflection of our customers.”</p>
         
        <p>The history of Espresso Royale dates back to the coffeehouses of North Beach, San Francisco and the early coffeehouses of Berkeley. The emphasis on great coffee and the ambiance of espresso bars in the early 80’s was the catalyst for the style and traditions of Espresso Royale.</p>
        
        <p>Our main goal, above all else, has always been to offer the best-tasting coffee. We work hard to procure our beans from farmers who grow their high-quality crops without pesticides and insecticides. The Espresso Royale House Blend, with its full-body, color, and flavor, was formulated in 1987 and designed for drinks such as cappuccinos and lattes.</p>
